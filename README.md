# Electro-optics-Project
# Modern Optics and Electro-Optics Final Project

This repository contains the implementation of solutions for the final project in the **Modern Optics and Electro-Optics** course. The project involves theoretical and practical exploration of advanced concepts in optics, including light propagation, lens modeling, and Fourier transforms.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following sections:
1. **Question 1**: Analysis of light transmission through polarizers and glass plates, exploring conditions for polarization and Brewster angles.
2. **Question 2**: Modeling and simulating lens behavior with wavelength-dependent refractive indices, including progression of rays through lenses.
3. **Question 3**: Fourier and Fresnel transformations, focusing on analyzing circular apertures and simulating diffraction patterns.

Each section includes MATLAB scripts that demonstrate the mathematical modeling, simulation, and visualization of results.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. **Run Scripts**:
   - Each question has a corresponding MATLAB script.
   - For example, to run the solution for Question 1:
     ```matlab
     run('Electro-optics_Q1.m')
     ```
3. **Visualization**:
   - The scripts generate plots and visualizations, such as transfer coefficients, diffraction patterns, and ray progression through lenses.

## Key Features

- **Polarization Analysis**: Simulations of light transmission through polarizers and calculation of Brewster angles.
- **Lens Modeling**: Using ABCD matrices and wavelength-dependent refractive indices for lens simulations.
- **Fourier Analysis**: Implementation of Fourier transforms for diffraction and aperture analysis.
- **Custom Functions**: Functions for circular aperture generation (`circ.m`), Fresnel propagation (`propFresnel.m`), and more.
